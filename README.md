# MERN_Ecommerce
This a unique Ecommerce project in which we have used a mern stack project which is a monolithic architecture, and converted into a micro-service architecture in which we have splitted each backend Node.js servers into independent micro-service.
As well as containerised it into seperate docker conatiners along with using the container orchestration tool i.e Kubernetes.
